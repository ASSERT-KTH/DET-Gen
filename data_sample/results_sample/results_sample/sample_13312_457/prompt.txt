Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\n\' character. \n\n  This is description: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function will then split the arguments into different variables, perform some calculations involving time and intervals, and then yield the number of intersections based on the conditions given in the while loop.  This is a passing test: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'10 30\\r\\r\\n10 35\\r\\r\\n05:20\'}``` generate a diffret test case'}]
