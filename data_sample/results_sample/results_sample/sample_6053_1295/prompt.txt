Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\n\' character. \n\n  This is description: The intention of this code is to define a function called `func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates whether there are enough resources to make a certain number of toasts based on the values of these arguments, and yields the number of toasts that can be made with the available resources.  This is a passing test: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\'}``` generate a diffret test case'}]
