The generated test input should be difference exposing, which means the following: when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\n\' character. \n\n  This is description: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then processes these arguments to determine the minimum of two values. The code then iterates through a loop, calculating a first answer and a second answer based on certain conditions. Finally, the function returns the minimum of the first and second answers, unless both answers are infinity, in which case it returns -1.  This is a passing test: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'20 2\\r\\r\\n9 19\'}``` generate a diffret test case'}]
