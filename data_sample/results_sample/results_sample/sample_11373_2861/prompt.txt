The generated test input should be difference exposing, which means the following: when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\n\' character. \n\n  This is description: The intention of this code is to define a function that calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a list of values generated by a nested loop with specific conditions. The function `func` takes variable length arguments `args`, extracts the necessary values `x, y, l, r`, and then generates a list `v` based on the conditions specified. Finally, it calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the list `v` and yields the result.  This is a passing test: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 3 1 10\'}``` generate a diffret test case'}]
