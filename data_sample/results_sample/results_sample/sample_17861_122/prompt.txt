The generated test input should be difference exposing, which means the following: when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\n\' character. \n\n  This is description: The intention of this code is to define a function that calculates a score based on the input values provided as arguments. The function first imports the \'sys\' module, then defines another function \'calc\' that takes three parameters (v, x, w) and calculates a score based on them. \n\nThe code then processes the input arguments provided as *args, splits them into lists, maps the third argument to integers, and calculates the score based on the values provided. The final score is calculated by iterating through a list of scores and calculating individual scores based on the input values. Finally, the total score is calculated based on a formula and returned as a yield statement.  This is a passing test: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'20 40 60 80 100\\r\\r\\n0 1 2 3 4\\r\\r\\n1 0\'}``` generate a diffret test case'}]
