This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, extracts the first argument, splits it into two integers, checks if both integers are odd, performs a calculation based on the values of the integers, appends the result to a global list, and returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
