This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, splits the first argument into two integers, and appends \'YES\' or \'NO\' to a global list based on the condition that the absolute difference between the two integers is less than or equal to 1. If the two integers are both 0, it appends \'NO\' to the global list. Finally, it returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
