This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, converts the first three arguments to integers, calculates the minimum value of the first argument, half of the second argument, and one-fourth of the third argument, and appends the result multiplied by 7 to a global list. Finally, it returns the global list containing the calculated value.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2\\r\\r\\n5\\r\\r\\n7\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
