This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to take a string as input, find the unique characters in the string, and determine if the number of unique characters is even or odd. If the number of unique characters is even, it will append \'CHAT WITH HER!\' to the global list. If the number of unique characters is odd, it will append \'IGNORE HIM!\' to the global list. Finally, it will return the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'wjmzbmr\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
