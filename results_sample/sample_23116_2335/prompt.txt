This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function first initializes an empty list called `global_list`. It then imports the `re` module for regular expressions and compiles a regular expression pattern that matches the word "hello" with any number of characters in between the letters.\n\nThe function then extracts the first argument passed to it, applies the regular expression pattern to it using the `findall` method, and stores the result in the `li` variable. If the result is empty (meaning the word "hello" was not found in the input string), the function appends \'NO\' to the `global_list`. Otherwise, it appends \'YES\' to the `global_list`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `global_list` containing either \'YES\' or \'NO\' based on whether the word "hello" was found in the input string.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'ahhellllloou\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
