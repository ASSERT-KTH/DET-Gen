This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in two arguments, splits them into two tuples, and then performs a calculation to determine if the second element of the first tuple is greater than or equal to the second element of the second tuple and if the remainder of the second element of the first tuple divided by the first element of the second tuple is equal to the remainder of the second element of the second tuple divided by the first element of the second tuple. If this condition is met, the second element of the first tuple is appended to a global list and the program exits. If the condition is not met after 1000 iterations, -1 is appended to the global list and the list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'20 2\\r\\r\\n9 19\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
