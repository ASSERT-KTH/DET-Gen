This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, sorts them in descending order, and then calculates the sum of the elements until the sum is greater than or equal to a given integer `k`. The function then returns a list containing the number of elements summed to reach `k` or `-1` if the sum is less than `k`, or `0` if `k` is less than or equal to `0`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5\\r\\n1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 1 1 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
