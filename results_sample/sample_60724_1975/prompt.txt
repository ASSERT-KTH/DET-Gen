This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, processes them, and returns a list of results based on certain conditions. The function `patched_func` takes the first argument as a string containing two space-separated integers `n` and `k`, converts them to integers, and then processes the subsequent arguments. It checks if the values of `n` and `k` are within a certain range, counts the occurrences of \'B\' and \'G\' characters in the input, and performs a series of operations on the input string based on certain conditions. Finally, it appends the processed string to a global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5 1\\r\\nBGGBG\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
