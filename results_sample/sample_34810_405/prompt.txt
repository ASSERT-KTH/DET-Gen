This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, converts the first argument to an integer, and then counts the number of times the digit 1 appears in the octal representation of that integer. The count is stored in a global list and returned as the output of the function.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'129\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
