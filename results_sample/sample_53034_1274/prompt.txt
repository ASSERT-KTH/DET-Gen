This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in five arguments, converts them to integers, and then performs a series of calculations based on those arguments. The function then appends the result to a global list and returns the list. The calculations involve finding the minimum of the first four arguments, checking if it equals 1, and then iterating through a range of numbers to find how many numbers are not divisible by any of the first four arguments.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n4\\r\\n12\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
