This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, converts the first argument to lowercase, and then appends a period before each consonant in the string. The consonants are defined in the `words` list. The resulting modified string is then appended to the `global_list` and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'tour\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
