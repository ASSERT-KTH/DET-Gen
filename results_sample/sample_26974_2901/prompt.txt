This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates a value based on the arguments, and appends the result to a global list. The function performs a series of calculations using the input arguments and returns the result in a list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5 5 10 5 4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
