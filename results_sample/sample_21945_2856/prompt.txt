This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to check if the input arguments meet certain conditions based on the values in the lists s1, s2, s3, and s4. If the conditions are met, the function appends \'YES\' to the global_list, otherwise, it appends \'NO\'. The function then returns the global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1 0 0 1\\r\\r\\n0 1 0 0\\r\\r\\n0 0 1 0\\r\\r\\n0 0 0 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
