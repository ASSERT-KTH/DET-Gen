This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, extracts the first argument, and then performs some conditional checks on the first character of the string to determine the value of `l`. The value of `l` is then appended to a global list called `global_list` and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'e4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
