This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then initializes an empty list called global_list and assigns the first argument to the variable s. It then iterates over each character in s and checks if the character is in the list L, which contains the characters \'H\', \'Q\', and \'9\'. If the character is found in L, the string \'YES\' is appended to global_list and the function exits. If no character is found in L, the string \'NO\' is appended to global_list. Finally, the function returns global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'Hi!\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
