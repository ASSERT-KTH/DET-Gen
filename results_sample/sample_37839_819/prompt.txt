This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, calculates the length of the longest sequence of consecutive consonants in the first argument, and returns a list containing the length of the longest sequence.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'ABABBBACFEYUKOTT\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
