Your generated test fails on the original version and passes on the patched version.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n"The following is the original version of a program: \n```python\ndef original_func(*args):\n\tglobal_list = []\n\t\n\tyear = args[0]\n\t\n\tdef check(year):\n\t    arr = [False for i in range(10)]\n\t    for i in range(len(year)):\n\t        if (arr[(ord(year[i]) - ord(\'0\'))] is True):\n\t            return False\n\t        else:\n\t            arr[(ord(year[i]) - ord(\'0\'))] = True\n\t    return True\n\tfor i in range((int(year) + 1), 9001):\n\t    if (check(str(i)) is True):\n\t        global_list.append(i)\n\t        break\n\treturn global_list``` \nThe following is the patched version of the program: \n```python\ndef original_func(*args):\n\tglobal_list = []\n\t\n\tyear = args[0]\n\t\n\tdef check(year):\n\t    arr = [False for i in range(10)]\n\t    for i in range(len(year)):\n\t        if (arr[(ord(year[i]) - ord(\'0\'))] is True):\n\t            return False\n\t        else:\n\t            arr[(ord(year[i]) - ord(\'0\'))] = True\n\t    return True\n\tfor i in range((int(year) + 1), 9001):\n\t    if (check(str(i)) is True):\n\t        global_list.append(i)\n\t        break\n\treturn global_list```\nGenerate a test input in Python dict format as follows:\n```python {\'inputdata\': <inputdata>}```\nThe generated test input should be difference exposing, which means ```python original_func(inputdata)!= patched_func(inputdata)```. This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a year as an argument and returns a list of years that are greater than the input year and have distinct digits. The function checks if the digits of the year are distinct and if not, increments the year by 1 until a year with distinct digits is found and appends it to the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1987\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
