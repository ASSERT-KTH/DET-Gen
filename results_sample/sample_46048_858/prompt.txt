This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, extracts the first argument, splits it into four integers, and then calculates a value based on the value of the first integer. The calculated value is then appended to a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1 1 3 4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
