This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function initializes an empty list called global_list and then converts the first argument to an integer. It then iterates over a range of numbers starting from n+1 up to 10000. For each number, it checks if the number of unique characters in the string representation of the number is equal to the length of the string. If this condition is met, the number is appended to the global_list and the loop breaks. Finally, the function returns the global_list containing the numbers that meet the condition.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1987\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
