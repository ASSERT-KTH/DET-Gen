This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function first initializes an empty list called `global_list`. It then checks if the first argument passed to the function is even or odd. If it is even, it appends a string of \'1\'s to the `global_list` based on the value of `n`. If it is odd, it subtracts 3 from `n`, appends \'7\' to the `global_list`, and then appends a string of \'1\'s to the `global_list` based on the value of `n`. Finally, it returns the `global_list`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
