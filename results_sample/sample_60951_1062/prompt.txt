This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then checks if the first argument contains either the number 4 or 7, and counts how many times these numbers appear. If the count is either 4 or 7, the function appends \'YES\' to a global list, otherwise it appends \'NO\'. Finally, the function returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'40047\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
