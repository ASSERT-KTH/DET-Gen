This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function creates a list called `global_list` and appends a string to it. The string is created by iterating over the characters in the first argument passed to the function, converting them to lowercase, removing any vowels (\'aeiouy\'), and then joining them together with a \'.\' in between each character. Finally, the function returns the `global_list`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'tour\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
