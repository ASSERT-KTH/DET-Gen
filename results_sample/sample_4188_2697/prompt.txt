This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function `patched_func` that takes a variable number of arguments, processes them, and returns a list containing the minimum of two calculated values. The function performs a series of calculations based on the input arguments and appends the result to a global list. The function returns this global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'20 2\\r\\r\\n9 19\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
