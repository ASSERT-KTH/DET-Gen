This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a year as an argument and returns a list of years that have distinct digits. The function starts by converting the input year to an integer and then iterates over the range of years from the input year to 9100. For each year, it checks if all the digits are distinct and appends the year to the global list if they are. Finally, it returns the list of years with distinct digits.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1987\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
