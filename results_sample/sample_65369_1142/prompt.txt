This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, splits the first argument into three integers, subtracts the second integer from the first integer, and then checks if the result is greater than the third integer. If it is, the result is set to the third integer plus one. The result is then appended to a global list and the list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 1 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
