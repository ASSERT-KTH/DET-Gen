This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that calculates the number of squares of size \'a\' that can fit into a rectangle of size \'n\' x \'m\'. The function takes in a list of arguments, splits it into three integers, calculates the width and length of the rectangle, and returns the total number of squares that can fit in the rectangle. The result is stored in a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'6 6 4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
