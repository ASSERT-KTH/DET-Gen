This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, converts the first three arguments to integers, and then performs a calculation based on the values of these arguments. The function calculates a new value for \'a\' based on the conditions in the while loop, appends the result of a mathematical expression to a global list, and then returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2\\r\\r\\n5\\r\\r\\n7\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
