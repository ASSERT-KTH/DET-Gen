This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that calculates the number of toasts that can be made based on the input arguments provided. The function takes a variable number of arguments, extracts the required values, and then calculates the number of toasts that can be made based on the available resources. The result is stored in a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
