This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to check if the input string contains the word "hello" in sequence. If the word "hello" is found in the input string, it will return \'YES\', otherwise it will return \'NO\'. The code uses a count variable to keep track of the characters in the word "hello" and appends \'YES\' to the global_list if the word is found, otherwise it appends \'NO\'.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'ahhellllloou\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
