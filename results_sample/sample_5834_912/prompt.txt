This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to calculate the number of problems Limak can solve within his spare time. The function takes in a string of numbers separated by spaces, converts them to integers, and then calculates the solving time for each problem. It then checks if the solving time exceeds Limak\'s spare time and appends the number of problems solved to a global list. Finally, it returns the global list containing the number of problems Limak can solve.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 222\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
