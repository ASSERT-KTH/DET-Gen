This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, extracts two integers from the first argument, and then performs a series of calculations based on the values of those integers. The function will continue to decrement the values of the integers based on the value of the counter variable \'cnt\' until one of the integers becomes negative. Depending on which integer becomes negative first, the function will append a string to the \'global_list\' and then return the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
