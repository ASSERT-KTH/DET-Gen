This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that calculates the number of weeks in a given month and day. The function takes a variable number of arguments, extracts the month and day from the first argument, calculates the number of weeks in that month, and appends the result to a global list. Finally, it returns the global list containing the number of weeks.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1 7\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
