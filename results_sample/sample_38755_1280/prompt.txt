This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, where the first argument is an integer `k` and the second argument is a string of integers separated by spaces. The function then converts the string of integers into a list of integers, sorts the list in descending order, and calculates the sum of the integers until the sum is greater than or equal to `k`. The function then returns a list containing either the count of integers used to reach the sum `k` or `-1` if the sum is less than `k`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5\\r\\n1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 1 1 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
