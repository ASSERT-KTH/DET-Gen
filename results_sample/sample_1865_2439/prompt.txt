This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in any number of arguments, converts the first two arguments to integers, adds them together, and then checks if the sum is equal to the third argument. If the sum is equal to the third argument, it appends \'YES\' to the `global_list`, otherwise it appends \'NO\'. Finally, it returns the `global_list`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'101\\r\\n102\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
