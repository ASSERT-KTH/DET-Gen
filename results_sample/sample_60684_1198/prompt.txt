This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, checks if the first argument contains the characters \'H\', \'Q\', or \'9\' and appends \'YES\' to a global list if it does, otherwise appends \'NO\'.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'Hi!\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
