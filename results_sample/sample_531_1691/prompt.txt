This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments, sorts the arguments, and then performs a series of mathematical operations on the sorted arguments. The result of these operations is then appended to a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 3 4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
