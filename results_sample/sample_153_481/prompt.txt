This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates the values of `m` and `l` based on the first argument passed in, and appends the results of two expressions to a global list. The function then returns the global list containing the results of the calculations.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'14\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
