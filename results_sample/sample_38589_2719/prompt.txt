This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that calculates the number of years required for an investment to double based on the formula provided. The function takes a string of two numbers separated by a space as input, converts them to integers, and then calculates the number of years required for the investment to double using the formula provided. The result is then appended to a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 7\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
