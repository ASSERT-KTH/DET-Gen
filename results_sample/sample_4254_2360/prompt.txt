This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes two arguments, splits them into lists of integers, and then appends \'YES\' or \'NO\' to a global list based on whether the integers in the two lists meet certain compatibility conditions. The compatibility conditions are defined in the `compatible` function, which checks if the first integer in the first list is less than or equal to the second integer in the second list plus 1, and if twice the first integer in the first list is greater than or equal to the second integer in the second list minus 2. The function then returns the global list containing either \'YES\' or \'NO\' based on the compatibility conditions.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5 1\\r\\n10 5\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
