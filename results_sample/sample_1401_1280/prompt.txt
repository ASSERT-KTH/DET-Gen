This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, sorts the second argument in descending order, and calculates the sum of the elements in the list until the sum is greater than or equal to the first argument. The function then appends the number of elements summed to a global list if the sum is greater than or equal to the first argument, otherwise it appends -1. Finally, the function returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5\\r\\n1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 1 1 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
