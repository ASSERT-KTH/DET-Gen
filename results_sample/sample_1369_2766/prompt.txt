This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, compares the elements of the first argument with its reverse, and appends \'YES\' or \'NO\' to a global list based on the number of differences between the original and reversed list. The function returns the global list after processing all the arguments.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'abccaa\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
