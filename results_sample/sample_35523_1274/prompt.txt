This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in five arguments, converts them to integers, and then iterates through a range of numbers from 1 to the fifth argument (e). For each number in the range, it checks if the number is divisible by any of the first four arguments (a, b, c, d). If the number is divisible by any of these arguments, it is added to a list called \'lis\'. The length of this list is then appended to a global list called \'global_list\' and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n4\\r\\n12\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
