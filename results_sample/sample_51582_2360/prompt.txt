This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in two arguments, splits them into lists of integers, and then checks if certain conditions are met based on the values in the lists. If the conditions are met, the function appends \'YES\' to a global list and returns it. Otherwise, it appends \'NO\' to the global list and returns it.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5 1\\r\\n10 5\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
