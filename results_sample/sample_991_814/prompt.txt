This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, extracts two integers k and r from the first argument, and then calculates the value of i such that the conditions specified in the while loop are met. The value of i is then appended to the global_list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'117 3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
