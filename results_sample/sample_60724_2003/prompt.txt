Your generated test fails on the original version and passes on the patched version.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '\n"The following is the original version of a program: \n```python\ndef original_func(*args):\n\tglobal_list = []\n\t\n\ta = args[0]\n\tb = []\n\tif (1000 <= int(a) <= 9000):\n\t    for k in range((int(a) + 1), 9001):\n\t        k = str(k)\n\t        for i in k:\n\t            b.append(i)\n\t        c = set(b)\n\t        g = len(c)\n\t        if (len(a) == g):\n\t            global_list.append(k)\n\t            break\n\t        b = []\n\treturn global_list``` \nThe following is the patched version of the program: \n```python\ndef patched_func(*args):\n\tglobal_list = []\n\t\n\ta = args[0]\n\tb = []\n\tif (1000 <= int(a) <= 9000):\n\t    for k in range((int(a) + 1), 9013):\n\t        k = str(k)\n\t        for i in k:\n\t            b.append(i)\n\t        c = set(b)\n\t        g = len(c)\n\t        if (len(a) == g):\n\t            global_list.append(k)\n\t            break\n\t        b = []\n\treturn global_list```\nGenerate a test input in Python dict format as follows:\n```python {\'inputdata\': <inputdata>}```\nThe generated test input should be difference exposing, which means ```python original_func(inputdata)!= patched_func(inputdata)```. This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to take a number as input and find the next number that has the same number of unique digits as the input number. The code checks if the input number is between 1000 and 9000, then iterates through numbers starting from the input number + 1 until it finds a number with the same number of unique digits. It then appends that number to a global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1987\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
