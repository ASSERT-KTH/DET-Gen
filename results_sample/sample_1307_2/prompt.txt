This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, extracts two integers from the first argument, calculates the minimum and half of the difference between the two integers, and appends these values to a global list. Finally, it returns the global list containing the calculated values.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
