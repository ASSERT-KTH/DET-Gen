This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes a variable number of arguments, processes them, and returns a list containing the minimum value of the four calculations performed on the input arguments. The calculations involve splitting the first argument into three integers, performing arithmetic operations on them, and then finding the minimum value among the results.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'10 20 30\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
