This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to take in a variable number of arguments, convert the first argument to a string, convert it to a set to remove duplicates, and then determine if the length of the set is even or odd. If the length is even, it will append \'CHAT WITH HER!\' to the global list, otherwise it will append \'IGNORE HIM!\'. Finally, it will return the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'wjmzbmr\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
