This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a list of arguments, extracts two integers from the first argument, calculates a fraction based on the extracted integers, and appends the fraction to a global list. The function then returns the global list containing the calculated fraction.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
