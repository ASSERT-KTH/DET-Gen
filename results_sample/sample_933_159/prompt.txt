This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, splits the first argument into a list, and then based on the values in the list, calculates a value for variable y. The value of y is then appended to a global list and the list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 of week\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
