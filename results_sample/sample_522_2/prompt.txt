This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, calculates the number of times a certain condition is met, and appends the results to a global list. The function takes the first argument, splits it into two integers, and then calculates the number of times a certain condition is met based on the values of the two integers. The results are then appended to the global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
