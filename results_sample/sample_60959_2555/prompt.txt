This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then checks if the first argument passed in has a length of at least 7. If it does, the function then checks if there are any consecutive sequences of 7 elements in the list where all elements are the same. If such a sequence is found, \'YES\' is appended to the `arr` list, otherwise \'NO\' is appended.\n\nAfter checking all possible sequences, the function then checks if \'YES\' is present in the `arr` list. If it is, \'YES\' is appended to the `global_list`, otherwise \'NO\' is appended. Finally, the `global_list` is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'001001\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
