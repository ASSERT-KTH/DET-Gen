This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, extracts two integers from the first argument, calculates a value based on the maximum of the two integers, and returns a list containing the calculated value as a string.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
