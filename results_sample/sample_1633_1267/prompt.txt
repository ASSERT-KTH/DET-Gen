This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, performs some calculations on the arguments, and returns a list containing the result of the calculations. The function checks if the input string `n` consists only of the characters \'4\' and \'7\', then splits the string into two halves, calculates the sum of the digits in each half, and checks if the sums are equal. If the sums are equal, the function returns \'YES\', otherwise it returns \'NO\'. The results are stored in a global list called `global_list` and returned at the end of the function.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2\\r\\n47\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
