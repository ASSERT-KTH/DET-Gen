This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates the sum of the first argument after splitting it into a list of integers, and then performs some operations on the list to determine the value to be appended to the `global_list`. The final result is a list containing the sum of the input list minus a calculated value `l`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'7 3 7 3 20\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
