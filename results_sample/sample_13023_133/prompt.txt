This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes two arguments, splits them into lists of integers, and then compares the elements of the two lists. It calculates the difference between corresponding elements and determines if there is enough "stash" to cover the difference. If there is enough stash, it appends \'Yes\' to the global list; otherwise, it appends \'No\'. Finally, it returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 4 0\\r\\r\\n2 1 2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
