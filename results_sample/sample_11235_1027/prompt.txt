This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, converts the first argument to an integer, and then appends a value to the `global_list` based on the value of the integer. If the integer is less than or equal to 10 or greater than 21, it appends 0 to the `global_list`. If the integer is equal to 20, it appends 15 to the `global_list`. Otherwise, it appends 4 to the `global_list`. Finally, it returns the `global_list`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'12\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
