This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, converts the first 5 arguments to integers, and then calculates the number of integers from 1 to e (inclusive) that are divisible by any of the first 4 arguments (a, b, c, d). The count of such integers is stored in a list called global_list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n4\\r\\n12\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
