This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, creates a string based on the value of the first argument, and appends the string to a global list. The string is constructed by alternating between "I love" and "I hate" based on whether the index is even or odd, and appending "that" after each phrase. Finally, "I love it" or "I hate it" is added to the end of the string based on whether the value of the first argument is even or odd.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
