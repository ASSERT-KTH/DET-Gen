This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments. The function then splits the first argument into three integers (a, b, c) and initializes a global list. It then iterates through a range of numbers from 0 to 10001 and checks if a certain condition is met based on the values of a, b, and c. If the condition is met, it appends \'Yes\' to the global list and exits the loop. If the condition is not met after iterating through the range, it appends \'No\' to the global list and returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 6 15\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
