This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function reads an integer n from the first argument, calculates a value based on n, and appends the result to a global list. Finally, the function returns the global list containing the calculated values.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
