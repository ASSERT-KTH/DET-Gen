This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to determine if a given string contains 7 consecutive identical characters. The function takes in a variable number of arguments, with the first argument being the string to be checked. It then iterates through the string, counting the number of consecutive identical characters. If it finds 7 consecutive identical characters, it appends \'YES\' to a global list. Otherwise, it appends \'NO\' to the global list. Finally, it returns the global list containing either \'YES\' or \'NO\' based on the presence of 7 consecutive identical characters in the input string.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'001001\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
