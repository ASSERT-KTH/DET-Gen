This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates a value based on the first argument passed in, appends the result to a global list, and returns the global list. The calculation involves raising 3 to the power of `(n - 1)` and taking the result modulo 1000003. If `n` is 0, the result is 1.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
