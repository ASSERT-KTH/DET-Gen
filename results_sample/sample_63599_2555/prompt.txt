This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. It initializes an empty list called `global_list`. It then assigns the first argument passed to the function to the variable `x`, and assigns the strings \'1111111\' and \'0000000\' to variables `y` and `z` respectively. \n\nThe code then checks if either \'1111111\' or \'0000000\' is present in the string `x`. If either of them is present, it appends \'YES\' to the `global_list`, otherwise it appends \'NO\'. Finally, it returns the `global_list`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'001001\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
