This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, stores them in a global list, and then calls another function called `sex_identifier` to determine whether the first argument is a male or female based on the length of the argument. The result of this determination is then appended to the global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'wjmzbmr\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
