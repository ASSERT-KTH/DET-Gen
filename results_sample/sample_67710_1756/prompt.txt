This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to take a list of colors as input, sort them, and then count the number of adjacent pairs of colors that are the same. The code then appends this count to a global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1 7 3 3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
