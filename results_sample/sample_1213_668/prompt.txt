This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, creates an empty list, and then appends a string to the list based on the value of the first argument passed to the function. The string is built by concatenating "I hate that" or "I love that" based on whether the index is even or odd, and then adding "I hate it" or "I love it" at the end of the string. The final list is then returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
