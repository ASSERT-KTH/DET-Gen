This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, splits the first argument into 5 separate values, converts them to integers, and then calculates the values of condl and condh based on these values. Finally, it appends the result of a calculation to a global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 1 1 1 2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
