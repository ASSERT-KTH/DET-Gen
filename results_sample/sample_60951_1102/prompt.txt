This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function converts the first argument to lowercase and then iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, y), it skips to the next character. Otherwise, it appends a period followed by the character to a new string. Finally, the new string is appended to a global list and the list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'tour\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
