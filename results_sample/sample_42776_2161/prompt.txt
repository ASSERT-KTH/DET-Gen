This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to determine the outcome of a tic-tac-toe game based on the board configuration provided as arguments to the `patched_func` function. The function checks for winning conditions for both players, detects illegal moves, and determines if the game is a draw. The result is stored in a global list and returned as the output of the function.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'X0X\\r\\n.0.\\r\\n.X.\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
