This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, checks if the second argument is divisible by the first argument, and appends \'YES\' to a global list if it is divisible, otherwise appends \'NO\' to the global list. The function also appends the number of times the second argument is divisible by the first argument to the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5\\r\\n25\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
