This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to take in a number and a string of numbers as arguments, convert the string of numbers into a list of integers, and then iterate through the list of numbers until the given number becomes zero. The code then appends either 7 or the index of the last number in the list to a global list and returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'100\\r\\n15 20 20 15 10 30 45\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
