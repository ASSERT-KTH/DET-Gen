This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to find the next number greater than the input number that has no repeating digits. The code takes an integer as input, increments it by 1, and then iterates through numbers until it finds a number that has no repeating digits (i.e., all digits are unique). Once such a number is found, it is added to a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1987\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
