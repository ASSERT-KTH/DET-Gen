This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes a variable number of arguments, concatenates a string based on the value of the first argument `n`, and appends the resulting string to a global list `global_list`. The string is constructed by alternating between "I hate" and "I love" based on whether the index `i` is odd or even, and appending "that" or "it" based on whether `i` is equal to `n`. Finally, the function returns the `global_list` containing the constructed string.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
