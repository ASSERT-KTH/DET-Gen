This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes a variable number of arguments, processes them, and returns a list of results based on the input arguments. The function calculates the maximum number in the list `d` and subtracts it from `k` until `k` is less than or equal to 0. The function then appends the number of iterations it took to reach that point to the `global_list` and returns it. If `k` is 0, it appends 0 to the `global_list`. If the list `d` is empty before `k` reaches 0, it appends -1 to the `global_list`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5\\r\\n1 1 1 1 2 2 3 2 2 1 1 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
