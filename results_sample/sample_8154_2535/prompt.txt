This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments, calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to n, and then calculates the remainder of m divided by the sum. It then calculates the value of m by subtracting i from m in a loop until m is less than 0, and then appends the final value of m to a global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 11\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
