This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, converts the first argument to an integer, and then checks if the integer is even and not equal to 2. If the condition is met, it returns \'YES\', otherwise it returns \'NO\'. The result is then appended to a global list and the list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'8\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
