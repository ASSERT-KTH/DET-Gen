This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function first initializes an empty list called global_list. It then checks if the first argument passed to the function is an integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive). If the condition is met, it calculates a value \'s\' based on the input \'n\' and appends it to the global_list. Finally, it returns the global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
