This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments. The function first initializes an empty list called global_list. It then imports the exit function from the sys module. The function then splits the first argument passed to it into two integers a and b. If the absolute difference between a and b is greater than 1, or if both a and b are equal to 0, the function appends \'NO\' to the global_list and exits the program. Otherwise, it appends \'YES\' to the global_list and exits the program. Finally, the function returns the global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
