This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a variable number of arguments, filters out numbers that contain the digits 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 0, and then checks if the first argument is divisible by any of the filtered numbers. If it is divisible by any of them, it appends \'YES\' to a global list, otherwise it appends \'NO\' to the global list. Finally, it returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'47\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
