This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, splits the first argument into three integers, and then calculates how many numbers between 1 and z are divisible by both n and m. The function then appends this count to a global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1 1 10\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
