This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function checks if the first argument passed to it is divisible by any of the numbers in the `lukcyNumbers` list. If it is divisible by any of the numbers, it appends \'YES\' to the `global_list` and exits the loop. If it is not divisible by any of the numbers, it appends \'NO\' to the `global_list`. Finally, it returns the `global_list` containing either \'YES\' or \'NO\' based on the divisibility of the given number.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'47\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
