This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then splits the first argument into three integers t, s, and x. It then checks if x is greater than or equal to 0, if x modulo s is either 0 or 1, and if x is not equal to 1. If all these conditions are met, the function appends \'YES\' to the global_list, otherwise it appends \'NO\'. Finally, the function returns the global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 10 4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
