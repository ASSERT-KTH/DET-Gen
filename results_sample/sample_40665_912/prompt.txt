This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates the number of problems a person can solve within a given time limit, and appends the result to a global list. The function takes the first argument, splits it into two integers n and k, calculates the remaining time after solving the problems, and then iterates to find the maximum number of problems that can be solved within the time limit. Finally, it appends the result to the global list and returns it.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 222\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
