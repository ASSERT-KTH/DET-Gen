This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then splits the first argument into two parts, `n` and `k`, and converts `k` into an integer. It then iterates through the reversed string `n` and counts the number of zeros until it reaches `k` zeros. It then appends the result to a global list and exits the loop. If it doesn\'t reach `k` zeros, it appends the total count of non-zero digits to the global list. Finally, it returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'30020 3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
