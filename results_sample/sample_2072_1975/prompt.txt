This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, processes them, and returns a list containing the modified sequence. The function reads the first argument to get the values of `n` and `t`, then reads the second argument as a sequence of characters. It then iterates over the sequence, swapping \'B\' and \'G\' characters if they appear in the correct order. The loop continues until the currentTime reaches the value of `t`. Finally, the modified sequence is appended to the `global_list` and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5 1\\r\\nBGGBG\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
