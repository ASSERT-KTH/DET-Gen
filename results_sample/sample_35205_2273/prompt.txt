This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then creates an empty list called global_list and imports the sys module. It then converts the first argument to an integer and iterates through a range of numbers from 1 to n+1. If the condition ((i * (i + 1)) / 2) == n is met, the string \'YES\' is appended to the global_list and the program exits. If the condition is not met, the string \'NO\' is appended to the global_list and the program exits. Finally, the global_list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
