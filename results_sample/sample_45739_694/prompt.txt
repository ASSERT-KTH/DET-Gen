This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to calculate the movement value based on the input arguments passed to the function `patched_func`. The function takes a variable number of arguments, calculates the movement value based on the conditions specified in the code, and appends the result to the `global_list`. The function then returns the `global_list` containing the calculated movement value.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'e4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
