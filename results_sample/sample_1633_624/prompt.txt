This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to take a string of numbers as input, split the string into individual numbers, perform some calculations based on the numbers, and then determine if a condition is met. If the condition is met, \'YES\' is appended to the global list, otherwise \'NO\' is appended. The global list is then returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 10 4\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
