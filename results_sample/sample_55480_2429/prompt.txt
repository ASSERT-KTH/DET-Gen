This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, splits the first argument into four integers, sorts three of them, and then calculates the minimum of the division of the fourth integer by 3 and the first sorted integer minus 1. It then calculates the minimum of the division of the difference between the fourth integer and the first minimum by 2 and the second sorted integer minus 1. Finally, it calculates the minimum of the difference between the fourth integer and the sum of the first two minimums and the third sorted integer minus 1. The function then appends the product of the three minimums plus one to a global list and returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 2 2 3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
