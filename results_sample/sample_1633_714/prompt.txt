This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes in a string of numbers, splits the string into individual numbers, performs some calculations on the numbers, and appends the result to a global list. The function then returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1 10 9 20 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
