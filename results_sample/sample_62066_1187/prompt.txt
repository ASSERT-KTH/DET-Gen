This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to take a word as input, iterate through each character of the word, and modify the characters based on their case (upper or lower). If the first character is lowercase, it will be converted to uppercase, and vice versa for uppercase characters. If any character is neither upper nor lower case, the word will be added to a global list and the loop will break. The modified word will be added to the global list if all characters are successfully processed. Finally, the global list containing modified words will be returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'cAPS\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
