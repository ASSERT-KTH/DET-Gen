This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that takes a variable number of arguments, calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in a list, and returns the result in a global list. The function first extracts four integers from the input arguments, then generates two lists of numbers based on the input values. It then calculates the sum of each pair of numbers from the two lists and stores the results in a new list. Finally, it calculates the maximum difference between consecutive elements in the new list and appends the result to the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 3 1 10\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
