This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then creates an empty list called global_list and imports the Counter class from the collections module. It then appends a tuple to the global_list based on whether the length of the keys in the Counter object created from the first argument passed to the function is even or odd. If the length of the keys is even, the tuple (\'CHAT WITH HER!\') is appended to the global_list, otherwise (\'IGNORE HIM!\') is appended. Finally, the global_list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'wjmzbmr\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
