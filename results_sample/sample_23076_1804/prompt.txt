This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to determine whether a given string has an even or odd number of unique characters. If the total number of unique characters is even, the function will append \'CHAT WITH HER!\' to the global list. If the total number of unique characters is odd, the function will append \'IGNORE HIM!\' to the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'wjmzbmr\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
