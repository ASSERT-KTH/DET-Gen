This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes a variable number of arguments, counts the occurrences of the characters \'4\' and \'7\' in the first argument, checks if the count of \'4\' and \'7\' in the total count is equal to the length of the total count, and appends \'YES\' or \'NO\' to a global list based on the condition. Finally, it returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'40047\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
