This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function `patched_func` that takes a variable number of arguments, processes the first argument (assuming it is a string), and returns a list containing the result of the processing. The function calculates the maximum distance between consecutive vowels in the input string and appends it to the `global_list` before returning it.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'ABABBBACFEYUKOTT\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
