This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, stores them in a list, and then performs a series of operations to calculate the length of unique words in the input string. The function then returns a list containing the length of unique words.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'abcd\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
