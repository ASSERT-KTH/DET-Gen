This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates the number of times the first argument must be multiplied by itself to reach the second argument, and appends \'YES\' and the number of times to a global list if the second argument is equal to the result of the multiplication, otherwise appends \'NO\' to the global list. Finally, it returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5\\r\\n25\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
