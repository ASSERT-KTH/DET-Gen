This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, creates an empty list called `global_list`, and then performs some operations based on the value of the first argument passed to the function. \n\nIf the first argument is an odd number, it appends `-1` to the `global_list`. If the first argument is an even number, it creates a list of numbers from 1 to `n`, swaps every pair of elements in the list, and then appends the modified list to the `global_list`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `global_list` after performing the necessary operations.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
