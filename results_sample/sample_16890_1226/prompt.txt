This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates a value based on the arguments, and appends the result to a global list. The function returns the global list containing the calculated value.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'100\\r\\n15 20 20 15 10 30 45\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
