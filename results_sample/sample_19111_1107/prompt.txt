This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: This code defines a function that takes a variable number of arguments. The function then processes the arguments, calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, and performs some operations based on the gcd. The function returns a list of results based on the operations performed.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 5 9\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
