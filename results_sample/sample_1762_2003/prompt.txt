This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments. The function creates an empty list called global_list and appends the result of a generator expression to it. The generator expression generates the next number greater than the first argument passed to the function (converted to an integer) that has unique digits (i.e., no repeated digits). The generator expression iterates over a range of numbers from the first argument plus one to 12345 and returns the first number that meets the condition of having unique digits. The function then returns the global_list containing the result.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1987\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
