This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function checks if the number of unique characters in the first argument is even or odd. If it is even, the function appends \'CHAT WITH HER!\' to the `global_list` and if it is odd, it appends \'IGNORE HIM!\' to the `global_list`. Finally, the function returns the `global_list`.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'wjmzbmr\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
