This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, splits the first argument into three integers, and then checks if there is a value of i such that a * i is less than or equal to c and (c - (a * i)) is divisible by b. If such a value of i is found, the function appends \'Yes\' to a global list and exits the program. If no such value of i is found, the function appends \'No\' to the global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'4 6 15\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
