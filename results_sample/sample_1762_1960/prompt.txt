This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments. The function creates an empty list called global_list and appends the sum of the absolute differences between the values of x and y (where x is in the range of 5 and y is the index of the value in the first argument split by spaces) to the global_list. The function then returns the global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'0 0 0 0 0\\r\\n0 0 0 0 1\\r\\n0 0 0 0 0\\r\\n0 0 0 0 0\\r\\n0 0 0 0 0\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
