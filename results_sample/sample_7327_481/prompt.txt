This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates the number of weekends in a given number of days (n), and returns a list containing the basic number of weekends and the maximum number of weekends. The code calculates the basic number of weekends based on the number of days and then adjusts it based on the remainder when dividing by 7. Finally, it appends the basic and maximum number of weekends to the `global_list` and returns it.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'14\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
