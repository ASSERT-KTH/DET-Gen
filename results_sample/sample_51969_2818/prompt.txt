This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments, calculates the value of `n` based on the first argument, and then uses that value to create a string `ans` by repeating the string \'aabb\' `time` number of times and appending the remaining characters from \'aabb\' based on the value of `L`. Finally, the function appends the `ans` string to a global list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
