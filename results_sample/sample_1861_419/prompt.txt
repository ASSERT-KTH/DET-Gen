This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, extracts three integers from the first argument, and then performs some calculations on these integers. The result of these calculations is then appended to a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'6 2 -5\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
