This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then initializes an empty list called global_list and extracts the first two arguments from the input. It then iterates through a range of numbers from 1 to 31 and checks if the first argument raised to the power of the current number is equal to the second argument. If it finds a match, it appends \'YES\' to the global_list along with the value of i - 1 and exits the loop. If no match is found, it appends \'NO\' to the global_list and returns the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5\\r\\n25\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
