This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to determine the direction of a point C in relation to a line formed by points A and B. The code calculates the direction by checking the sign of the cross product of vectors AB and BC. If the cross product is positive, the point C is to the left of the line, if it is negative, the point C is to the right of the line, and if it is zero, the point C is towards the line. The result is stored in a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'0 0\\r\\n0 1\\r\\n1 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
