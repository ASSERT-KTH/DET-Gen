This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The code defines a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments. The function creates a global list and then assigns a list of numbers to the variable odp. The function then retrieves the first argument passed to it, subtracts 1 from it, and uses the result as an index to retrieve a value from the odp list. This value is then appended to the global list and the global list is returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
