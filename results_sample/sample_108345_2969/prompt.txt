This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function `patched_func` that takes a variable number of arguments, calculates the time taken for two characters to complete a task based on the input parameters, and then compares the times to determine which character finishes first, second, or if they finish at the same time. The result is stored in a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'5 1 2 1 2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
