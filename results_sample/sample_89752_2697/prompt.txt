This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers, and then performs some calculations based on the input arguments passed to the function. The function takes two arguments, splits them into pairs of integers, calculates the gcd of the first pair, and then checks if the difference between the second pair is divisible by the gcd. If it is, the function iterates over a range of numbers and appends the ones that satisfy certain conditions to a global list. If the difference is not divisible by the gcd, the function appends -1 to the global list. Finally, the function returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'20 2\\r\\r\\n9 19\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
