This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, creates an empty list called global_list, and then performs some operations based on the first argument passed to the function. The function checks if the first argument is even or odd, and then appends a string of \'1\'s or \'7\'s followed by \'1\'s to the global_list based on the result. Finally, the function returns the global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
