This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes a variable number of arguments. The function then splits the first argument into two integers, a and b, and checks if a and b are equal to 0. If they are, it appends \'NO\' to the global_list. If the absolute difference between a and b is less than or equal to 1, it appends \'YES\' to the global_list. Otherwise, it appends \'NO\' to the global_list. Finally, the function returns the global_list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'2 3\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
