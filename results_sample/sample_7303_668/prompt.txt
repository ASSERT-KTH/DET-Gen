This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called patched_func that takes in a variable number of arguments, concatenates a string based on the first argument, and appends the string to a global list. The string is constructed by alternating between \'I hate\' and \'I love\' based on whether the index is even or odd, and appending \'it\' at the end. The global list containing the constructed string is then returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
