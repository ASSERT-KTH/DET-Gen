This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to calculate the minimum number of shots that can be made based on the quantities of drinks, limes, and salt available. The code takes input arguments, calculates the total drinks, limes, and salt needed for the shots, and then determines the minimum number of shots that can be made based on these quantities. The result is stored in a global list and returned.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
