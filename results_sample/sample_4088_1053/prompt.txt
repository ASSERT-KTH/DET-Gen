This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function then calculates a value `n` based on the first argument passed in, and then iterates through a range of values to find a combination of \'7\'s and \'4\'s that add up to `n` where the number of \'7\'s is divisible by 7 and the number of \'4\'s is divisible by 4. The function then appends this combination to a global list and returns the list. If no valid combination is found, it appends -1 to the list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'11\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
