This means when the test input is given to the original and patched versions, they should produce different outputs. Your output should not contain any explanation or \'\\n\' character.\n\n\nThis is description of the patched program: The intention of this code is to define a function called `patched_func` that takes in a variable number of arguments. The function checks whether the input word has more uppercase letters than lowercase letters. If it does, it appends the word in uppercase to a global list. If not, it appends the word in lowercase to the global list. Finally, it returns the global list.\nThis is a sample test input for which both versions produce the same output: ```python {\'inputdata\': \'HoUse\'}```\nGenerate a difference exposing test input as described above.'}]
